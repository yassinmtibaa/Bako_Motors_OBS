This guide outlines the complete GitHub workflow for collaborating on the ISS Report project.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

1. **Git installed:** [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download)
2. **GitHub account:** [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
3. **Access to repository:** Request from project lead
4. **SSH key configured:** [GitHub SSH Setup Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
5. **Git configured locally:**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

---

## 🚀 Initial Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone via SSH (recommended)
git clone git@github.com:organization/iss-report.git
cd iss-report

# Or via HTTPS (if SSH not configured)
git clone https://github.com/organization/iss-report.git
cd iss-report
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
# Check remote URL
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  git@github.com:organization/iss-report.git (fetch)
# origin  git@github.com:organization/iss-report.git (push)

# Check your configuration
git config --list | grep user
```

---

## 🔄 Standard Workflow

### 1. Start New Work

**Before starting, always update your local repository:**

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# Update your local main branch
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

**For Section Work:**

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/section-XX-your-name

# Naming convention examples:
git checkout -b feature/section-06-circuit-design
git checkout -b feature/section-12-agile-management
git checkout -b feature/section-20-recommendations
```

**For Other Work:**

```bash
# Bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/description

# Documentation
git checkout -b docs/description

# Configuration/Setup
git checkout -b setup/description

# Examples:
git checkout -b fix/compilation-error
git checkout -b docs/readme-update
git checkout -b setup/github-workflows
```

### 3. Edit Your Section

```bash
# Edit your assigned section file
nano "Section Files/06-circuit-design.tex"

# Or use your preferred editor
code .
```

### 4. Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage specific file
git add "Section Files/06-circuit-design.tex"

# Or stage specific section files
git add Section\ Files/06-*.tex

# Or stage all changes (use carefully)
git add .

# Check what's staged
git status
```

### 5. Commit Changes

**Write meaningful commit messages:**

```bash
# Single-line commit
git commit -m "Add content to Section 06: Circuit Design & Electronics"

# Multi-line commit (recommended for larger changes)
git commit -m "Add comprehensive Circuit Design section

- Add Schematics & PCB Design subsection (3.2 pages)
- Add Battery Management System (BMS) Design subsection (2.8 pages)
- Add Motor Drive & Inverter Design subsection (2.5 pages)
- Include 5 new technical diagrams
- Add 8 new bibliography references"
```

**Commit Message Guidelines:**

```
# Format
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>

# Example

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Your branch is behind by X commits"

```bash
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
```

### Issue: "Merge conflict" (when pulling)

# After resolving:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin feature/your-branch
```

### Issue: "Need to undo last commit"

```bash
# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo last push (use carefully!)
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Issue: "Accidentally committed to main"

```bash
# Create new branch from current commit
git branch feature/my-section

# Reset main to previous state
git reset --hard origin/main

# Switch to your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-section
```

### Issue: "Want to see what changed in a commit"

```bash
git show <commit-hash>
